# Calculations of earth curvature

Although I'm firmly in the "spherical earth" camp, I have friends who range
from "curious about" to "convinced by" flat or hollow earth hypotheses. This
repository is my attempt to allow exploration of these viewpoints so that
the inquistive mind can test which one holds up best to objective reality.

My eventual goal is to develop a site similar to Ulrich Deuschle's
[panorama generator](http://www.udeuschle.selfhost.pro/panoramas/makepanoramas_en.htm)
but having choice of output to match more than one of these 3 "theories".
That should give the most convincing proof of one "viewpoint" over the other,
since what one sees from a mountaintop should be distinctly different between
a "flat", "round", or "hollow" earth.

The Python script `earthcurvature.py`, based on the formulas shown at
[earthcurvature.com](http://earthcurvature.com/) and
[dizzib.github.io](https://dizzib.github.io/earth/curve-calc/), although its
output differs from those sites by a small amount, probably due to my choice
of the value of `R` (earth radius), should help lay one claim to rest,
that of "If there were 266 feet of curvature in 20 miles, I'd be able to see
it". The script output shows that in 1/10 of a mile -- 528 feet -- there is
only about *2mm* of "drop" due to curvature. If you've ever shot at targets
at 100 yards using an iron-sighted rifle, you'll know how small something looks
at that distance, and 528 feet is closer to *2* football fields' distance. So
if you can't see 2mm in 528 feet, you can't arguably see any curvature over
20 miles either. What you *should* be able to see, on a curved earth, is that
things at a distance are most often (except during anomalies of atmospheric
refraction) are partially or fully hidden from view by that curve.
